## THP W11D4 - Developer track - "Winter 2022 is coming...": The THP RPG!

### :one: Content :scroll:

Welcome to the greatly expected RPG of year 2022 : "Winter 2022 is coming: THP The Learning Gathering".  
This "still WiP" little game was realized as an exercise to learn and improve on Javascript, on POO, and on POO in Javascript :smile:.  
As a possible solution to the proposed trial, you'll enjoy:

- **Diverse character classes** 7 in total, from classic warriors and knights, to magicians and monks, ninjas and even a GibbZ, a very rare and ancient God (yes, your read it well :wink:). Each with their own characteristics (HP, DMG, MGC), strengths and witnesses.
- **Several attack and combat styles** Not only will you be able to play with diverse classes of warriors but this game will also offer you to test different attacks, standard ones and not so standard others dealing greater damages and/or healing yourself ans/or inducing extra side-effects to pepper-up the game!
- **An easy to handle gameplay** Follow the card selector to know which player is ready to attacke, decide on your strategy depending on your health and techniques, the use the built-in "in-game panel" to play: it's as simple as 1... 2... 3... 1: choose your target 2: choose to attack or cast a special spell, then... Oh! There's no "3", so it's even simpler than stated abaove :wink:
- **Nice 2000's Gfx** Nice full page background HD image, transparency, tooltips detailing the special attacks, DDL, reactive buttons, etc. This game has all the bells and whistles you need to spend a nice and playful moment! It uses the most cutting-edge web front technologies, such as: Bootstrap 5.1+ and the 1.8+ version of their icons, Javascript ES6+, Google Fonts, etc.

### :two: How to :bulb:

1. Create an empty directory on your :computer:
2. Clone the current :octocat: repository to the latter
3. Launch the "index.html" file (no local web server should be needed)
4. Character after character, and round after round:
5. Choose who you're going to attack thanks to the dedicated DDL
6. Select how you're going to hit him / her : standard or special attacke, what are you in the mood for?
7. If a character reaches 0 health point, he / she dies and won't play anymore
8. Have super fun :satisfied: with this genuine Magic-The-Gathering-like heroic fantasy card game!

### :three: Missing features / Possible evolution :rocket:

- Correct and complete management of victory(ies), after each player's turn, at the end of a round (before end of the game / total rounds), or at the end of the total planned number of rounds.
- Gain of 20 :sparkles: each time you kill another warrior
- Side-effects of some of the special attacks (_e.g._ invincibility of the assassin the following turn he launches his "Shadow Hit", possibility for the Monk class to self heal...)
- Prevent "return to life" when dead and hit by the Monk special attack (or not... May be nice to keep it as is. What do you think?)
- Add some animations (flipping cards, changing backgrounds each turn) and shadows to make it more lively
- Improve responsiveness (cards behave quite OK but "in-game panel" could do lot better)
- ...
